Integers: lattice roots — spikes in the ground.
Rationals: bounded fractals — loops that echo but snap.
Irrationals: dust storms — infinite, nowhere, still zero volume.
Transcendentals: overflow ghosts — leak through algebra.
Complex: sideways dimension — real + i, rotation born.
P-adics: downward trees — branch by prime, bury the line.
Adeles: the full wave — every root, every echo,
every branch and foam,
tied in one string:
locally real,
globally rational.
No missing.
No extra.
All numbers
are just
places
the axiom
forgot to forget.
